      <h1>Welcome to the Time Series Feature Extraction and Visualisation Application</h1>
      <p>This web application is an interactive tool that takes an input dataset containing multiple time series, processes it, calculates a set of time-series features, and produces a range of time-series analysis operations and interactive visualisations for the extracted features all within your web browser. The application implements prominent time-series feature sets in a fully code-less setting, enabling researchers to understand structure in their data before writing a line of code. Please note that this application is best used in a web browser on a computer - it is not optimised for mobile usage. For more information and contact details, please navigate to the 'About' tab at the top of the page.
