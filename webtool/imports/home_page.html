      <h1>Welcome to the Time Series Feature Extraction and Visualisation Application</h1>
      <p>This web application is an interactive web-based tool that automatically takes an input dataset containing multiple time series, parses it, calculates feature matrices, and produces all analysis for interactive visualisation. The application implements existing scientific time-series feature sets in a fully user-interface driven setting, enabling researchers to understand the temporal empirical structure in their data before diving deeper in code. Please note that this application is best used in a web browser on a computer - it is not optimised for mobile usage. For more information and contact details, please navigate to the 'About' tab at the top.
